				<p class="project-p">The Art Hander Collective wanted a simple and efficient website to advertise their services and create an online presence outside of social media. They expressed a need for custom forms with email forwarding and a way to tie in a custom built scheduling app they've been developing internally. Their priority was a lightweight site that gave clients the information they needed to properly describe and spec their projects for quotes and approval. </p>

						<p class="project-p">Primeaux Knives was interested in reworking its e-commerce page to improve performance, customer traffic, and user experience. Together, we built a flexible and versatile platform for sharing their high-craft tools with a wide user base. Their business model relies on heavy product turnover month-to-month, which places high demand on frequently changing website assets to reflect new products.</p>
						
						<p class="project-p">I acted as engineer, creative director, and copywriter throughout the duration of the site revamp. We established a repeatable methodology for producing, cataloging, and organizing assets and copy for monthly 'drops,' while also creating bonus content and value via social media and email marketing. We found unique ways to utilize existing documentation and promotional materials to build a well-rounded brand identity that reflected Primeaux's southern roots and tech and engineering savviness.</p>

					<p class="project-p">Viola Yesiltac had an existing portfolio that wasn't working the way she needed it to. She utilizes her website to connect with galleries, institutions, curators, and collectors. The old website was slow and disorganized, and made sharing new work difficult.</p>

					<p class="project-p">I revamped and optimized menus, galleries, file sizes and image compression, layout, documents, and removed unnecessary apps and features. I also performed a site-wide re-captioning of all artworks to MLA standards for artwork documentation. </p>

				<p class="project-p">I have a diverse background and foundation in art and technology. Having worked in the NYC fine arts and fabrication world for the last 13 years, I've used a breadth of digital and physical tools to help artists and institutions execute their work. In 2023, I decided to add building websites and applications to that list of skill sets. Now, I'm fully in on tech and closing one door in order to open another into the world of web development.</p>

				<p class="project-p">I'm passionate about building lightweight, efficient websites and applications that work seamlessly across devices. My goal is to provide users the same value whether they're surfing the web on their Samsung Smart refrigerator, deprecated iPhone 6, or the newest Windows laptop. My design sense is informed by my lifelong passion for the arts and visual culture. I aim to make deliberate structural text and image choices that directly impact the user's experience. If it doesn't add value, does it need to exist?</p>
				
				<p class="project-p">When I'm taking a break from writing code, you can find me taking photographs with a Nikon F3, going for long bike rides in the city, collecting art books, or building small sculptures out of traditional materials.
